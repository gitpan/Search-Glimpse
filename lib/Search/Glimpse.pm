#
# A tool for searching in a glimpse index via the glimpseserver system.
# It unfortunately requires opening a pipe to glimpse but that's not 
# the end of the world I suppose.
#
# A better version would write directly to the glimpserver socket
# but I don't feel like having time to mess with decoding that.

=head1 NAME

Search::Glimpse - Perl extension to communicate with Glimpse server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use Search::Glimpse;

  my $glimpse = Search::Glimpse->new;

  my @results = $glimpse->search("search this string");

=head1 ABSTRACT

  This module is an extension to use glimpse server from Perl.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Quick hack to connect to glimpse server.

=cut




=head2 new

Creates a new glimpse object.

=cut

sub new {
  # create the object
  # and establish the file extension filter if needed
  my $class = shift;
  my $self = {};
  $self->{'hits'} = 0;
  $self->{'files'} = 0;

  # get the incoming parms
  my %parms = @_;
  $self->{server} = $parms{server} || "localhost";
  $self->{nr_hits} = $parms{nr_hits} || 100;

  my $ext_filter = $parms{'ext_filter'};
  my $sto_filter = $parms{'sto_filter'};

  # can't have both or we're buggered
  return undef if ($sto_filter && $ext_filter);

  # set the filter
  if ($ext_filter) {
    $self->{'filter'} = "$GLIMPSE_FILTER '\.$ext_filter" . '$' . "'";
  }
  if ($sto_filter) {
    # $ext_filter = $STO_EXT;
    # $self->{'filter'} =
    # "$GLIMPSE_FILTER '/$sto_filter#\.$ext_filter" . '$' . "'";
    #
    # at the moment I'll maintain this commented, as STO_EXT is not
    # defined, and I do not know how to define it.
  }

  return bless $self, $class;

=head2 search

Search on a glimpse object

=cut

    # that can't possibly be good, except we are single quoting below
    # and don't allow quotes in the search
